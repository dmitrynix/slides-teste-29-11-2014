    In software testing, test automation is the use of special software
    (separate from the software being tested) to control the execution of
    tests and the comparison of actual outcomes with predicted outcomes. Test
    automation can automate some repetitive but necessary tasks in a
    formalized testing process already in place, or add additional testing
    that would be difficult to perform manually.
